* TO BUILD ONSCRIPTER-EN FOR YOUR USE

Here is the usual procedure:

  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install


This will use gcc by default; to use icc, start with
  CC=icc ./configure


* DEALING WITH MISSING LIBRARIES

If you do not have the libraries necessary for building ONScripter-EN
installed on your system, you may try installing the ONScripter Static
Libraries manager (onscrlib), which is available at
<http://unclemion.com/dev/projects/onscrlib>

For best results, unpack onscrlib in the same parent folder where
the onscripter-en source release folder can be found, since onscripter-en
will check ../onscrlib by default.  You may also set the location of onscrlib
by configuring with something like

  ./configure --onscrlib-path=path/to/onscrlib


* DEALING WITH UNHELPFUL LIBRARIES

Some system-provided libraries are not ideally configured for use with
ONScripter-EN.  For example, some system-provided SDL libraries cause
stuttering audio.  You can usually fix this by using the onscrlib
package and configuring with something like

  ./configure --with-internal-sdl

(use --help to get a list of the options you can use to selectively
replace libraries with internal versions).


* TO BUILD A RELATIVELY REDISTRIBUTABLE ONSCRIPTER-EN BINARY

Configure with

  ./configure --with-internal-libs

to statically link as many libraries as possible into the executable,
which makes life better on systems with more primitive application
installation methods, such as OS X and Windows.

If you are compiling ONScripter-EN for a system with modern package
management - say, creating a binary package for a specific Linux
distribution - then it may make more sense to omit the
--with-internal-libs, compile a dynamically linked executable, and
have your package depend on the regular platform-specific packages for
SDL, Freetype, and all the other dependencies.  However, you may still
need to include some libraries internally to make everything work.


* NOTES

For Windows builds, use a MinGW toolchain in the MSYS environment.

For Mac OS X there is an XCode project file in the "macosx" directory.
The game data can either be stored in the Contents/Resources within the
bundle, or run ONScripter.app from within the game directory itself.
